# Disabling YouTube Playback

Streaming from youtube is against YouTube's terms of service. A lot of Discord Bots have been banned for streaming from YouTube. If you want to avoid getting banned, you should disable YouTube playback in your bot.

Discord Player does not support YouTube unless you are using a third party extractor. Make sure you are selecting the right extractors to avoid any issues.

Note that Discord Player still supports youtube url resolver (i.e. parsing your raw input to determine if it's a youtube url). This behavior does not violate YouTube's terms of service. You may use this feature to implement youtube detection and disable youtube playback.
