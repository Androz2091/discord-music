Discord Player is a powerful and easy-to-use music framework for Discord.js. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API to play music in your Discord bot. This guide will help you integrate Discord Player in your Discord bot.

## Installation

First, you need to install the Discord Player and its dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```package-install
npm install discord-player @discord-player/extractor
```

<Callout>
  We are also installing `@discord-player/extractor` as it contains the default extractors for Discord Player which
  provides ability to play audio from local files, raw url or SoundCloud. **Discord Player on itself does not support
  anything.**
</Callout>

## Initialization

To use Discord Player, you need to initialize it in your bot. Here is an example of how you can initialize Discord Player:

<Tabs items={['discord.js', 'eris']}>
<Tab value='discord.js'>

```js title="index.js"
import { Client } from 'discord.js';
import { Player } from 'discord-player';

const client = new Client({
  /* options */
});
const player = new Player(client);
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="eris">

```js title="index.js"
import Eris from 'eris';
import { Player, createErisCompat } from 'discord-player';

const client = Eris({
  /* options */
});
const player = new Player(createErisCompat(client));
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

That's it! You have successfully initialized Discord Player in your bot.

<Callout>
  Even though Discord Player supports Eris, the guide from here will focus on discord.js. You can refer to the [Eris
  documentation](https://abal.moe/Eris/docs) for more information on Eris specific APIs. Concept wise, both discord.js
  and Eris are similar.

In the next section, we will learn about extractors and how to integrate them to support audio streaming.
