Discord Player context allows your bot to manage queues and other player specific features more efficiently. **If you do not wish to use context, you may skip this guide.**

## Setting up Player Context

To set up the player context, you need to provide the context data to the player context provider. Here is an example of how you can set up the player context:

```js title="command-handler.js"
// Almost all command handlers have the following line of code
await command.execute(interaction); // [!code highlight]
```

You will need to wrap `command.execute` in a player context provider like this:

```js title="command-handler.js"
import { useMainPlayer } from 'discord-player'; // [!code highlight]

// inside your command handler
const player = useMainPlayer(); // [!code highlight]

// [!code highlight]
const data = {
  guild: interaction.guild, // [!code highlight]
}; // [!code highlight]

await player.context.provide(data, () => command.execute(interaction)); // [!code highlight]
```

  Keep in mind, the command handler above is just an example. Your command handler may look different. Make sure to
  adjust the code according to your needs.

  `useMainPlayer` is a hook that provides the main player instance. You must call this hook after initializing the
  player.

In the example above, we are providing the guild data to the player context. This allows the player to manage the queue and other player specific features more efficiently.
