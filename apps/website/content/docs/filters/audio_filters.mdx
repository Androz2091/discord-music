Discord Player supports various audio filters. There are 4 types of audio filters in discord-player.

### FFmpeg

The most common and powerful method is FFmpeg. It supports a lot of audio filters. To set ffmpeg filter, you can do:

```js title="nightcore.js"
await queue.filters.ffmpeg.toggle(['bassboost', 'nightcore']);
```

Note that there can be a delay between filters transition in this method.

### Equalizer

This equalizer is very similar to Lavalink's 15 Band Equalizer. To use this, you can do:

```js title="bass.js"
queue.filters.equalizer.setEQ([
  { band: 0, gain: 0.25 },
  { band: 1, gain: 0.25 },
  { band: 2, gain: 0.25 },
]);
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using equalizer.

### Biquad

This filter provides digital biquad filterer to the player. To use this, you can do:

```js title="lowpass.js"
import { BiquadFilterType } from 'discord-player';

queue.filters.biquad.setFilter(BiquadFilterType.LowPass);
// similarly, you can use other filters such as HighPass, BandPass, Notch, PeakEQ, LowShelf, HighShelf, etc.
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using biquad filters.

### Resampler

</Callout>

This filter provides resampling to the player. This filter is identical to `await queue.filters.ffmpeg.toggle(..)` with `vaporwave` or `nightcore` filters. To use this, you can do:

```js title="resampler.js"
// resample current audio to 1.3 times the current sample rate
queue.filters.resampler.setSampleRate(48000 * 1.3);

// resample using predefined preset
const enabled = queue.filters.resampler.toggleFilter('nightcore'); // or 'vaporwave'

// currently applied sample rate
console.log(queue.filters.resampler.sampleRate);
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using resampler.

### Other Filters

This is another type of audio filters provider. It currently supports `Tremolo` and `8D` filters only. To use this, you can do:

```js title="8d.js"
queue.filters.filters.setFilters(['8D']);
```

There is no delay between filters transition using this filter.
