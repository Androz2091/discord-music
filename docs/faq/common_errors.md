# "something" is not working

- Try attaching `debug` listener to `player.events` to see if something strange is going on. 

- If you are getting weird errors like something is not a constructor or version.split is not a function or something similar, please try the following:

    Remove `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` or any lockfiles you have, run `npm cache clean --force` or similar command equivalent to your package manager and then run `npm install` (or the install command of your package manager)
